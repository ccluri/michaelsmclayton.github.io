                    <h5>I was born in London in November 1990. After receiving a BSc in Psychology from the University of Exeter in 2013, I completed a PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford (2014-2018).</h5>
                    <h5>During this doctoral research, I focused on how sustained visual attention is supported by oscillations in human brain activity. Specifically, I investigated the ways in which alpha oscillations (7-13 Hz), recorded over visual regions of the brain, contribute to visual processing. I did this by delivering alternating electrical currents to posterior cortex at varying frequencies, and observing the effects of this stimulation on visual attention task performance. The results of this research have been published in the <a href="./FinalPapers/Electrical Stimulation of Alpha Oscillations Stabilizes Performance on Visual Attention Tasks.pdf"><i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00067/full"><i>Frontiers in Neuroscience</i></a>.</h5>
                    <h5>After submitting my PhD thesis, I wanted to gain experience in research outside of scientific institutions. I worked initially as a Science Intern, and then a Research Engineer, at <a href="http://www.cambridgecognition.com/">Cambridge Cognition</a> - a digital neuroscience company that specialises in providing cognitive assessment software for clinical research. Here, I learned about software development in a commercial environment (e.g. version control, development life cycles, DevOps), as well as how to run cognitive psychology experiments using online platforms (i. e. <a href="https://www.mturk.com/"> Mechanical Turk</a> and <a href="https://prolific.ac/">Prolific Academic</a>). More recently, I have also been hired as a Consultant Data Scientist on a project with <a href="https://www.unit9.com/">Unit 9</a> and <a href="https://www.ford.co.uk/">Ford</a>, using EEG to help monitor driver cognition during competitive racing.</h5>

                                </h3>
                                <h5 style="margin-top: 2vh;" align=center>During my doctoral research, I focused a great deal on psychological theories of cognitive control, as well as the neuroscience of how distributed, functional brain networks facilitate successful engagement of such control (e.g. cingular-opercular, fronto-parietal networks). More specifically though, my research has centred on the importance of neural oscillations in visual attention and perception, both in the effective communication of signals between anterior brain regions and sensory areas (<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(15)00028-5">see my review paper in <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i></a>), as well as fine-grained temporal control of perceptual processes (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.13747">see my review paper in the <i>European Journal of Neuroscience</i></a>).</h5>

                                <h5 style="margin-top: 2vh;" align=center>In most of my experiments, I have used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure human brain activity. More recently though, I have started collaborating with researchers at the University of Cambridge, analysing ultra-high field (i.e. 7 Telsa) MRI data to assess the different contribitions of cortical layers in visual processing. In addition, however, my research has also focused strongly on methods of neuromodulation, using both magnetic and electrical stimulation to influence brain actiivty directly, and measuring the cognitive effects of such changes to assess the causal roles played by specific neural patterns in cognition.</h5>

                            <h5 style="margin-top: 2vh;" align=center>In addition to psychology and neuroscience, I have a strong interest in programming languages. During my PhD, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB"><b>MATLAB</b></a> extensively for stimulus design and presentation (using <a href="http://psychtoolbox.org/">Psychtoolbox</a>). I also used MATLAB for my analyses of behavioural and neural oscillation data (using libraries like <a href="https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php">EEGLAB</a> and <a href="http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/">Fieldtrip</a>). I have commonly used <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software">SPSS</a>, but have more recently transferred entirely to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"><b>R</b></a> for my statistical analyses.</h5>
                            <h5 align=center>As well as traditional cognitive testing, I am also very interested in running cognitive and perceptual experiments online. To develop these online studies, I have therefore learned front-end web development languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><b>HTML</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><b>CSS</b></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><b>Javascript</b></a>.

                            <h5 style="margin-top: 2vh;" align=center>I have found that an ideal intersection of my interests in neuroscience and programming is computational neuroscience. For example, based on published research, I have coded models of neural areas (made of Izhikevich neurons) to simulate the enhancing role of alpha band phase synchronisation in long-range neural communication (<a href="https://github.com/michaelsmclayton/PulvinarControlOfCorticalGammaViaAlpha">see link</a>). I have also focused on using convolutional neural networks to model differences in learned receptive fields from lower to higher levels of visual cortex (<a href="https://github.com/michaelsmclayton/BinocularNeuralNetwork">see link</a>).</h5>

                            We rely on sustained attention to protect task performance against fatigue and distraction. Time-related variations in attention correlate with amplitude changes of specific cortical oscillations. However, the ways in which these oscillations might support sustained attention, how these oscillations are controlled, and the extent to which they influence one another remain unclear. We address this issue by proposing an oscillatory model of sustained attention. Within this framework, sustained attention relies on frontomedial theta oscillations, inter-areal communication via low-frequency phase synchronisation, and selective excitation and inhibition of cognitive processing through gamma and alpha oscillations, respectively. Sustained attention also relies on interactions between these oscillations across attention-related brain networks.

                                In recent decades, our appreciation of the complexity of the brain has deepened immensely, as has our understanding of how it performs key functions. In the face of such complexity, and given the rising cost of neuropsychiatric illness (1), an intriguing question is whether we can promote further understanding, and in some cases enhancement, of the typical and atypical brain by targeted modulation of its activity. Notably, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)–which involves transcranial application of weak sinusoidal electrical currents (2)–seems ideally suited to address this question, as it has been demonstrated to modulate endogenous oscillatory electrical activity (3), enhance cognitive functions (4–7), and provide support in neurological disease (8, 9). However, a complete mechanistic pathway between the neuronal and cognitive effects of tACS remains in need of explication, precluding both significant theoretical contribution by tACS studies, and the development of more adaptive neuroenhancement regimes. Therefore, in this Opinion article, we briefly review the role of oscillatory neuronal activity in cognition, before outlining one potential pathway by which the interaction between tACS and endogenous oscillations at a network level may be reconciled with its effects on broader cognitive functions.

                            A central feature of human brain activity is the alpha rhythm: a 7–13 Hz oscillation observed most notably over occipitoparietal brain regions during periods of eyes‐closed rest. Alpha oscillations covary with changes in visual processing and have been associated with a broad range of neurocognitive functions. In this article, we review these associations and suggest that alpha oscillations can be thought to exhibit at least five distinct ‘characters’: those of the inhibitor, perceiver, predictor, communicator and stabiliser. In short, while alpha oscillations are strongly associated with reductions in visual attention, they also appear to play important roles in regulating the timing and temporal resolution of perception. Furthermore, alpha oscillations are strongly associated with top‐down control and may facilitate transmission of predictions to visual cortex. This is in addition to promoting communication between frontal and posterior brain regions more generally, as well as maintaining ongoing perceptual states. We discuss why alpha oscillations might associate with such a broad range of cognitive functions and suggest ways in which these diverse associations can be studied experimentally.

                                Neural oscillations in the alpha band (7–13 Hz) have long been associated with reductions in attention.
                                However, recent studies have suggested a more nuanced perspective in which alpha oscillations also
                                facilitate processes of cognitive control and perceptual stability. Transcranial alternating current stimulation
                                (tACS) over occipitoparietal cortex at 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) can selectively enhance EEG alpha
                                power. To assess the contribution of alpha oscillations to attention, we delivered alpha-tACS across four
                                experiments while 178 participants performed sustained attention tasks. Poor performance on all visual
                                tasks was previously associated with increased EEG alpha power. We therefore predicted initially that
                                alpha-tACS would consistently impair visual task performance. However, alpha-tACS was instead found
                                to prevent deteriorations in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham- and 50 Hz-tACS.
                                This finding was observed in two experiments, using different sustained attention tasks. In a separate
                                experiment, we also found that alpha-tACS limited improvements on a visual task where learning was
                                otherwise observed. Consequently, alpha-tACS appeared to exert a consistently stabilizing effect on
                                visual attention. Such effects were not seen in an auditory control task, indicating specificity to the visual
                                domain. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the view that alpha oscillations facilitate
                                processes of top-down control and attentional stability

                            Neural oscillations in the alpha band (7–13 Hz) are commonly associated with disengagement of visual attention. However,
                            recent studies have also associated alpha with processes of attentional control and stability. We addressed this issue in
                            previous experiments by delivering transcranial alternating current stimulation at 10 Hz over posterior cortex during visual
                            tasks (alpha tACS). As this stimulation can induce reliable increases in EEG alpha power, and given that performance on each
                            of our visual tasks was negatively associated with alpha power, we assumed that alpha tACS would reliably impair visual
                            performance. However, alpha tACS was instead found to prevent both deteriorations and improvements in visual performance
                            that otherwise occurred during sham & 50 Hz tACS. Alpha tACS therefore appeared to exert a stabilizing effect on visual
                            attention. This hypothesis was tested in the current, pre-registered experiment by delivering alpha tACS during a task
                            that required rapid switching of attention between motion, color, and auditory subtasks. We assumed that, if alpha tACS
                            stabilizes visual attention, this stimulation should make it harder for people to switch between visual tasks, but should
                            have little influence on transitions between auditory and visual subtasks. However, in contrast to this prediction, we
                            observed no evidence of impairments in visuovisual vs. audiovisual switching during alpha vs. control tACS. Instead, we
                            observed a trend-level reduction in visuoauditory switching accuracy during alpha tACS. Post-hoc analyses showed no effects
                            of alpha tACS in response time variability, diffusion model parameters, or on performance of repeat trials. EEG analyses
                            also showed no effects of alpha tACS on endogenous or stimulus-evoked alpha power. We discuss possible explanations for
                            these results, as well as their broader implications for current efforts to study the roles of neural oscillations in
                            cognition using tACS.
