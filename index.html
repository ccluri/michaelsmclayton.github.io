                    <h5>I was born in southern England in November 1990. After receiving a BSc in Psychology from the University of Exeter in 2014, I completed a PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford (<a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/michael-clayton">see department profile page</a>).</h5>
                    <h5>During my doctoral research, I focused on how sustained visual attention might be supported by oscillations in human brain activity. Specifically, I investigated the ways in which visual attention might be supported by alpha oscillations (7-13 Hz) in visual regions of the brain. I did this by delivering alternating electrical currents to posterior cortex at various frequencies, and observing the effects this electrical stimulation on visual attention task performance. The results of this research have been published in the <a href="./FinalPapers/Electrical Stimulation of Alpha Oscillations Stabilizes Performance on Visual Attention Tasks.pdf"><i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00067/full"><i>Frontiers in Neuroscience</i></a></h5>
                    <h5>After submitted my PhD thesis, I worked as a Science Intern for <a href="http://www.cambridgecognition.com/">Cambridge Cognition</a> - a digital neuroscience company which develops cognitive tests for use in pharmaceutical trials. Here, I learned about software is developed in commercial environments (e.g. version control, development life cycles), and how to run cognitive psychology experiments using online platforms (namely, <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a> and <a href="https://prolific.ac/">Prolific Academic</a>).</h5>

                                <h5 align=center>My PhD research in sustained concentration taught me a lot about psychological theories of cognitive control, as well as the neuroscience of how distributed, functional brain networks facilitate successful engagement of such control (e.g. cingular-opercular, fronto-parietal networks). More specifically though, my research has focused on the importance of neural oscillations in visual attention, both in the effective communication of signals from anterior brain regions to sensory areas (<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(15)00028-5">see my review paper in <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i></a>), as well fine-grained temporal control of perceptual processes (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.13747">see my review paper in the <i>European Journal of Neuroscience</i></a>).</h5>

                            We rely on sustained attention to protect task performance against fatigue and distraction. Time-related variations in attention correlate with amplitude changes of specific cortical oscillations. However, the ways in which these oscillations might support sustained attention, how these oscillations are controlled, and the extent to which they influence one another remain unclear. We address this issue by proposing an oscillatory model of sustained attention. Within this framework, sustained attention relies on frontomedial theta oscillations, inter-areal communication via low-frequency phase synchronisation, and selective excitation and inhibition of cognitive processing through gamma and alpha oscillations, respectively. Sustained attention also relies on interactions between these oscillations across attention-related brain networks.

                                In recent decades, our appreciation of the complexity of the brain has deepened immensely, as has our understanding of how it performs key functions. In the face of such complexity, and given the rising cost of neuropsychiatric illness (1), an intriguing question is whether we can promote further understanding, and in some cases enhancement, of the typical and atypical brain by targeted modulation of its activity. Notably, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)–which involves transcranial application of weak sinusoidal electrical currents (2)–seems ideally suited to address this question, as it has been demonstrated to modulate endogenous oscillatory electrical activity (3), enhance cognitive functions (4–7), and provide support in neurological disease (8, 9). However, a complete mechanistic pathway between the neuronal and cognitive effects of tACS remains in need of explication, precluding both significant theoretical contribution by tACS studies, and the development of more adaptive neuroenhancement regimes. Therefore, in this Opinion article, we briefly review the role of oscillatory neuronal activity in cognition, before outlining one potential pathway by which the interaction between tACS and endogenous oscillations at a network level may be reconciled with its effects on broader cognitive functions.

                            A central feature of human brain activity is the alpha rhythm: a 7–13 Hz oscillation observed most notably over occipitoparietal brain regions during periods of eyes‐closed rest. Alpha oscillations covary with changes in visual processing and have been associated with a broad range of neurocognitive functions. In this article, we review these associations and suggest that alpha oscillations can be thought to exhibit at least five distinct ‘characters’: those of the inhibitor, perceiver, predictor, communicator and stabiliser. In short, while alpha oscillations are strongly associated with reductions in visual attention, they also appear to play important roles in regulating the timing and temporal resolution of perception. Furthermore, alpha oscillations are strongly associated with top‐down control and may facilitate transmission of predictions to visual cortex. This is in addition to promoting communication between frontal and posterior brain regions more generally, as well as maintaining ongoing perceptual states. We discuss why alpha oscillations might associate with such a broad range of cognitive functions and suggest ways in which these diverse associations can be studied experimentally.

                            of our visual tasks was negatively associated with alpha power, we assumed that alpha tACS would reliably impair visual
                            performance. However, alpha tACS was instead found to prevent both deteriorations and improvements in visual performance
                            that otherwise occurred during sham & 50 Hz tACS. Alpha tACS therefore appeared to exert a stabilizing effect on visual
                            attention. This hypothesis was tested in the current, pre-registered experiment by delivering alpha tACS during a task
                            that required rapid switching of attention between motion, color, and auditory subtasks. We assumed that, if alpha tACS
                            stabilizes visual attention, this stimulation should make it harder for people to switch between visual tasks, but should
                            have little influence on transitions between auditory and visual subtasks. However, in contrast to this prediction, we
                            observed no evidence of impairments in visuovisual vs. audiovisual switching during alpha vs. control tACS. Instead, we
                            observed a trend-level reduction in visuoauditory switching accuracy during alpha tACS. Post-hoc analyses showed no effects
                            of alpha tACS in response time variability, diffusion model parameters, or on performance of repeat trials. EEG analyses
                            also showed no effects of alpha tACS on endogenous or stimulus-evoked alpha power. We discuss possible explanations for
                            these results, as well as their broader implications for current efforts to study the roles of neural oscillations in
                            cognition using tACS.

                                Neural oscillations in the alpha band (7–13 Hz) have long been associated with reductions in attention.
                                However, recent studies have suggested a more nuanced perspective in which alpha oscillations also
                                facilitate processes of cognitive control and perceptual stability. Transcranial alternating current stimulation
                                (tACS) over occipitoparietal cortex at 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) can selectively enhance EEG alpha
                                power. To assess the contribution of alpha oscillations to attention, we delivered alpha-tACS across four
                                experiments while 178 participants performed sustained attention tasks. Poor performance on all visual
                                tasks was previously associated with increased EEG alpha power. We therefore predicted initially that
                                alpha-tACS would consistently impair visual task performance. However, alpha-tACS was instead found
                                to prevent deteriorations in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham- and 50 Hz-tACS.
                                This finding was observed in two experiments, using different sustained attention tasks. In a separate
                                experiment, we also found that alpha-tACS limited improvements on a visual task where learning was
                                otherwise observed. Consequently, alpha-tACS appeared to exert a consistently stabilizing effect on
                                visual attention. Such effects were not seen in an auditory control task, indicating specificity to the visual
                                domain. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the view that alpha oscillations facilitate
                                processes of top-down control and attentional stability
